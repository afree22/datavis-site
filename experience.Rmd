  <h2>Data Intensive Scientific Computing - Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)</h2>
  <h4>University of Notre Dame - Summer 2018</h4>
During the summer of 2018, I participated in the Data Intensive Scientific Computing REU at Notre Dame. I was placed in Dr. Michael Ferdigâ€™s laboratory, which focuses on bioinformatics and malaria. I developed software in R to process malaria genomic data from a genetic cross (sequenced with Illumina Next Generation sequencing) and select genetically unique, clonal progeny with no missing data. I also developed an R software package to perform QTL analysis in a shared parent population (2 different crosses with one parent in common), based on the paper, <i> Joint QTL Linkage Mapping for Multiple-Cross Mating Design Sharing One Common Parent </i>. Using a shared parent population provides more phenotypic diversity and provides greater statistical power to detect genes with small effects.

<h2><br/>Health Informatics - Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)</h2>
<h4>Indiana University - Summer 2017</h4>
During the summer of 2017, I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Health Informatics at Indiana University to explore the ways technology can be utilized to improve healthcare.  My project partner and I designed an "electronic toolkit," a set of customizable sensors that would assist and improve an elderly population in their day to day living. To learn about the needs of this elderly population we attended crafting session. Our goal was to make a toolkit that older adults could use different types of sensors to enhance the functionality of objects already in their home. I co-authored a manuscript, which we plan to submit to the Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interactions after conducting a user study with older adults at the end of this summer.
